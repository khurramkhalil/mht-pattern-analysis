"MHT Pattern Analysis" is a data analysis project aimed at using mathematical and statistical methods to identify patterns and trends in multi-target tracking data. The project involves collecting and analyzing data from a multi-target tracking system, and using this data to develop models and algorithms that can be used to identify and characterize patterns in the tracking data. The goal of this project is to provide insights and understanding into the behavior of multiple objects being tracked, and to help identify areas for improvement in the tracking system.

The project involves the use of mathematical and statistical techniques, such as data clustering, regression analysis, and machine learning algorithms. The project would also likely involve the use of data visualization techniques to help understand the patterns in the data.
